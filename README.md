Flappy Bird Clone

This project is a Flappy Bird-inspired game developed as part of my portfolio to demonstrate and improve my skills in Unity game development. It is a simple but functional replica of the popular game, optimized for mobile platforms.

Project Details

Development Process
No Preliminary Design:
No class diagrams or detailed plans were constructed prior to development. The focus was on hands-on learning and implementation.

Assets Used:
The game assets were sourced from https://www.spriters-resource.com/mobile/flappybird/sheet/59894/. 

Role of AI:
AI tools were heavily utilized throughout the project. They provided assistance in:

* Debugging
* Understanding Unity concepts
* Optimizing C# scripts
While the AI was instrumental in completing this project, I have committed to minimizing reliance on it in future endeavors.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Key Learnings

Unity Concepts:
* Gained a solid understanding of SerializeField for variable visibility and customization in Unity’s Inspector.
* Learned about Singleton patterns and how to use Instance for cross-class communication.

Hands-On Experience:
This project helped bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical Unity game development.

Features

Core Gameplay:
Players navigate a bird through pipes to achieve the highest possible score.

Responsive UI:
Includes a title screen, in-game UI, and a game-over screen with score and medal displays.

Medal System:
Players earn medals based on their score:

Bronze (10+)

Silver (20+)

Gold (30+)

Platinum (40+)

Mobile Optimization:
Integrated touch controls for seamless gameplay on mobile devices.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Challenges

No Initial Planning:
Without a structured plan, I had to adapt and troubleshoot issues as they arose.

Understanding Unity Features:
Struggled initially with Unity-specific concepts like the SerializeField attribute and Singleton patterns.

Overcoming Over-Reliance on AI:
While AI was an invaluable resource, I recognized the importance of independent problem-solving and have vowed to limit AI assistance in future projects.

Future Goals

* Avoid relying on AI for development.
* Add sound effects and background music.
* Incorporate dynamic obstacles for increased variety.
* Create structured plans for future projects, including class diagrams.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project marks a significant step in my game development journey. It helped me understand the value of planning, the role of external resources, and the importance of personal growth through hands-on experience.
